GEMMA 3N has audio capabilities 

Here we test if it can be finetuned to transcribe Kinyarwanda audio files 

The Juypter notebooks 

1. Data Preparation  : prepare data for finetuning 
2. Gemma3N_Baseline : tests how well the tokenizer supports Kinyarwanda and transcribe kinyarwanda audio to see how the model performs 


Test_Baseline: examples of transcribed texts from audio compared with the reference text (ground truth)
